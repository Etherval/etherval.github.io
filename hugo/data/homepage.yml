        They was helping us on analyzing our server architecture when we were having a bottleneck issue on our server.
        Finally we found out the main problem that caused our server work inappropriately.
        Not only that, at the end of the session, 
        They helped us by providing us comprehensive report about the problems and the suggestions to be taken in order to make our server more scalable in the future.
